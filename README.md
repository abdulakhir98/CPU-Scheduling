# CPU-Scheduling

The aim is to learn about CPU Scheduling. A table like the following in a text file named Input.txt is given to the code.

There are three Ethernet cards in the machine. Each process runs some CPU cycle then reads data from any of the Ethernet cards. The processes arrive in order, i.e. P1 then P2 and then P3. This code calculates following three things and store them in a file named Output.txt
- Using the FCFS algorithm it should list down the order of execution of the pro-
cesses.
- Calculate the total time of execution of all processes.
- Calculate the average waiting time.
